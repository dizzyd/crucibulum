/// The crucible rides in the forge's own work item slot, which is possible at all because the 1.22
/// forge accepts and heats any collectible flagged <c>forgable</c>. What this class adds is the
/// charge: four ingredient slots that stand in for the firepit's cooking slots, so that
/// <see cref="BlockSmeltingContainer"/>'s own CanSmelt/DoSmelt run unmodified and every alloy
/// recipe in the game works here too. The heat is this class's as well -- see HeatCrucible for why
/// vanilla's own ramp has to be written over rather than left alone -- and so is the drawing, since
/// the pool of metal and the capped glow are <see cref="CrucibleRenderer"/>'s, not the forge's.
///
/// The charge lives in the forge's slots rather than in the crucible stack, exactly as it does in a
/// firepit. It does not get left behind, though: taking the crucible hands the ore back first, and
/// a crucible that leaves by any other route -- dragged out of the window, swapped for an ingot --
/// is caught by OnSlotModifiedServer, which does the same.
