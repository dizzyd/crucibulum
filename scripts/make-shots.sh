# Shots need a bigger window and particles, which vstestkit's client template turns off for
# deterministic visual baselines. The template is swapped for the boot and put straight back;
# it lives in the slot's own checkout, so no other tenant on the box sees it, and it is only
# read at boot anyway.
#
# Shadows stay OFF. Asking for them on this headless GL setup crashes the client at startup
# with "FBO ShadowmapFar: One or more attachment points are not framebuffer attachment
# complete", and a swallowed crash here is invisible: run.sh simply boots its own session with
# the restored template and you get small, particle-free shots that look like success.
